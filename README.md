# SA Essentials

[![](https://github.com/ins1x/sa-essentials/raw/main/CLEO/(for%20developers)/gta-sa-lib-pack-essentials.png)](https://www.mixmods.com.br/2019/06/sa-essentials-pack/)

A pack of necessary libs for the correct operation of [GTA San Andreas Multiplayer (SA-MP)](https://sampwiki.blast.hk/) and mods.  
forked form [**JuniorDjjr**](https://github.com/JuniorDjjr) [*sa-essentials-pack*](https://www.mixmods.com.br/2019/06/sa-essentials-pack/)  

The main difference from the [*original sa-essentials-pack*](https://www.mixmods.com.br/2019/06/sa-essentials-pack/) pack, is that there are only the necessary libraries and script loaders. Fixes and mods are not included! 

# How use it 

You should already have [GTA:SA and SA:MP](https://www.sa-mp.mp/downloads/) installed.
After install, just copy all files from archive to your Gta San Andreas game directory.

> Before replacing libs, save the replacement files in case of a version conflicts!
